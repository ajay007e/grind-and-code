## ðŸ“œ Description

<p>You have two fruit baskets containing <code>n</code> fruits each. You are given two <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays <code>basket1</code> and <code>basket2</code> representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets <strong>equal</strong>. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Chose two indices <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, and swap the <code>i<font size="1">th</font>&nbsp;</code>fruit of <code>basket1</code> with the <code>j<font size="1">th</font></code>&nbsp;fruit of <code>basket2</code>.</li>
	<li>The cost of the swap is <code>min(basket1[i],basket2[j])</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.</p>

<p>Return <em>the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or </em><code>-1</code><em> if impossible.</em></p>




## ðŸ§ª Examples

### Example 1
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> basket1 = [4,2,2,2], basket2 = [1,4,1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Swap index 1 of basket1 with index 0 of basket2, which has cost 1. Now basket1 = [4,1,2,2] and basket2 = [2,4,1,2]. Rearranging both the arrays makes them equal.
</pre>


### Example 2
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> basket1 = [2,3,4,1], basket2 = [3,2,5,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> -1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> It can be shown that it is impossible to make both the baskets equal.
</pre>




## ðŸ“Œ Constraints"
<ul>
	<li><code>basket1.length == basket2.length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= basket1.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= basket1[i],basket2[i]&nbsp;&lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>
</ul>

            for _ in range(abs(count) // 2):
                to_swap.append(cost)

        to_swap.sort()
        min_overall_cost = min(basket1 + basket2)
        res = 0

        for i in range(len(to_swap) // 2):
            direct_swap = to_swap[i]
            indirect_swap = 2 * min_overall_cost
            res += min(direct_swap, indirect_swap)

        return res
