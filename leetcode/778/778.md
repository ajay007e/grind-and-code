## ðŸ“œ Description

<p>You are given an <code>n x n</code> integer matrix <code>grid</code> where each value <code>grid[i][j]</code> represents the elevation at that point <code>(i, j)</code>.</p>

<p>It starts raining, and water gradually rises over time. At time <code>t</code>, the water level is <code>t</code>, meaning <strong>any</strong> cell with elevation less than equal to <code>t</code> is submerged or reachable.</p>

<p>You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most <code>t</code>. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.</p>

<p>Return <em>the minimum time until you can reach the bottom right square </em><code>(n - 1, n - 1)</code><em> if you start at the top left square </em><code>(0, 0)</code>.</p>




## ðŸ§ª Examples

### Example 1
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
</pre>


### Example 2
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 16
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
</pre>




## ðŸ“Œ Constraints"
<ul>
	<li><code>n == grid.length</code></li>
	<li><code>n == grid[i].length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 50</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= grid[i][j] &lt;&nbsp;n<sup>2</sup></code></li>
	<li>Each value <code>grid[i][j]</code> is <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
</ul>

                return t

            for ni, nj in ((i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)):
                if ni < 0 or nj < 0 or ni >= n or nj >= n or (ni, nj) in seen:
                    continue
                seen.add((ni, nj))
                heapq.heappush(h, (max(t, grid[ni][nj]), ni, nj))
