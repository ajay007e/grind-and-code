## 📜 Description

<p>There are <code>n</code> houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>colors</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>colors[i]</code> represents the color of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> house.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> distance between <strong>two</strong> houses with <strong>different</strong> colors</em>.</p>

<p>The distance between the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> and <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> houses is <code>abs(i - j)</code>, where <code>abs(x)</code> is the <strong>absolute value</strong> of <code>x</code>.</p>




## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> colors = [<u><strong>1</strong></u>,1,1,<strong><u>6</u></strong>,1,1,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.
The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.
House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.
</pre>


### Example 2
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> colors = [<u><strong>1</strong></u>,8,3,8,<u><strong>3</strong></u>]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and color 3 is green.
The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.
House 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3. The distance between them is abs(0 - 4) = 4.
</pre>


### Example 3
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> colors = [<u><strong>0</strong></u>,<strong><u>1</u></strong>]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 1.
House 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1. The distance between them is abs(0 - 1) = 1.
</pre>




## 📌 Constraints"
<ul>
	<li><code>n ==&nbsp;colors.length</code></li>
