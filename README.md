# 🧠 daily-code-grind

Welcome to **daily-code-grind** – a personal repository for my daily coding practice.  
This repo includes solutions to competitive programming problems, data structures & algorithms, and interview prep challenges from platforms like:

- LeetCode
- Codeforces
- CodeChef
- AtCoder
- HackerRank

### 🔥 Goal
To build problem-solving skills through consistent practice – one problem at a time, every day.

### 🛠️ Tech & Language Stack
- Primary language: `C++` / `Java` / `Python` (customize based on what you use)
- Structured by platform and topic for easy reference
